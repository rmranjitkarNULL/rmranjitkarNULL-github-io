										<h1>Autonomous Mapping Robot</h1>
									</header>
										<p>
											Our team of four developed an autonomous mapping robot that implements Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using ROS and Python. 
											Over the course of the project, we integrated a LIDAR sensor for environment perception, 
											implemented frontier-based exploration to identify unknown regions, and developed path planning and control strategies for navigation. 
											The system combined localization, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making into a cohesive framework by incorporating A* for global path planning, 
											pure pursuit for smooth trajectory following, and a potential fields–based control method that used LIDAR data to treat obstacles as repulsive forces for steering adjustments. 
											Together, these components enabled the robot to autonomously build a map of its surroundings while exploring efficiently and safely.

												<h3>System Architecture</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>
												Our system was built on the TurtleBot3 platform and organized as a modular set of ROS nodes that communicated through topics and services. 
												At the perception level, the gmapping package provided real-time SLAM to construct a 2D occupancy grid from LiDAR scans and odometry. 
												For localization, we used Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) to maintain an accurate pose estimate through particle filtering. 
												A custom FrontierFinder node identified unexplored boundaries in the map, while the PathPlanner node generated collision-free routes to selected frontiers using an A* algorithm on an inflated configuration space. 
												These paths were then executed by the PathMovement node, which applied a pure pursuit controller to convert planned trajectories into smooth velocity commands. 
												This modular structure allowed us to integrate mapping, exploration, planning, and control into a cohesive framework that could be tested and tuned independently.

												<h3>Pure Pursuit</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>
												We implemented a pure pursuit controller to enable smooth and continuous trajectory following. 
												Instead of simply moving from waypoint to waypoint, the robot computed a lookahead point along the planned path and adjusted 
												its steering to minimize the error between its current heading and the target point. 
												This approach improved path smoothness and reduced oscillations, especially in narrow corridors. 
												The controller incorporated safeguards for sharp turns, including rotation-in-place when angular corrections exceeded a threshold. 
												Overall, pure pursuit provided stable and predictable navigation across varied path geometries.

												<h3>Frontier Exploration</h3>

                                            <p>
												To drive autonomous exploration, we implemented a frontier-based strategy. 
												The occupancy grid generated by SLAM was analyzed to detect frontiers, or boundaries between known and unknown regions. 
												The system clustered candidate frontier cells, computed centroids, and ranked them using a scoring function based on both size and distance. 
												The highest-scoring centroid was selected as the next exploration goal. 
												This ensured that exploration was both efficient and comprehensive, prioritizing regions that would expand the map most effectively.

												<h3>Path Planning</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>
												For global navigation, we developed a custom A* path planner. 
												Operating over an inflated configuration space (C-space), the planner accounted for the robot’s footprint and maintained a buffer from obstacles. 
												The heuristic combined Euclidean distance to the goal with distance-to-wall penalties and angle penalties, 
												generating smoother and safer paths that avoided hugging walls or making excessive sharp turns. 
												The planned path was published as a nav_msgs/Path and tracked in real time by the pure pursuit controller.

												<h3>Monte Carlo Localization</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>
												We used Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL), a particle filter–based algorithm, to estimate the robot’s pose within the map. 
												The algorithm maintained a distribution of possible poses and updated them based on LIDAR scans and odometry. 
												Our implementation leveraged no-motion updates to improve localization accuracy while stationary, reducing drift without requiring unnecessary movement. 
												Over time, the particle set converged toward the true robot pose, enabling reliable localization throughout exploration and mapping.

												The system was successfully deployed on a TurtleBot3 in a maze-like indoor environment. 
												The robot efficiently mapped all reachable frontiers and completed exploration in 101 seconds with minimal human intervention. 
												Path following was precise, with the pure pursuit controller producing smooth turns and stable tracking even in tight spaces. 
												The robot also demonstrated the ability to return to its starting location within one robot radius, showing consistency in both navigation and localization. 
												While we encountered challenges with localization drift during the final return phase, the system consistently performed robustly during mapping and exploration, 
												validating the effectiveness of our frontier exploration, A* planning, and pure pursuit control strategies.
