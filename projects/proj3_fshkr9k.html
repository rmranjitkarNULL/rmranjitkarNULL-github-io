									</header>
										<p>
											FishShocker9000 is an embedded system developed for UMass Chan Thyme Labs to support biological research involving zebrafish studies. 
											The system is designed to generate controlled high-voltage pulses that can be used in experiments requiring precise electrical stimulation. 
											At its core, the project combines custom PCB hardware, embedded C/C++ firmware, and testing scripts to provide researchers with a reliable, configurable tool. 
											Looking forward, FishShocker9000 is being extended with a computer vision (CV) implementation to automate fish detection and stimulation, 
											further streamlining experimental workflows and reducing the need for manual intervention.

												<h3>Circuit</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>
												The FishShocker9000 circuit was built around a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller, which generates control signals with precise timing. 
												These signals are converted into analog outputs using a DAC and amplified through 
												an operational amplifier to achieve the desired output voltage. 
												To safely deliver stimulation in water, the amplified signals are routed through 
												H-bridges, which swap the polarity of the pulses to prevent continuous DC current and minimize electrolysis. 
												Power for the entire system is supplied by a buck converter, stepping down 
												the wall outlet voltage to stable levels for both the logic and power electronics. 
												Finally, the controlled signals are delivered through metal plates, which act as electrodes to transmit the shocks in the zebrafish environment.

											</header>
                                            <p>
												To integrate and streamline the hardware, we designed a 2-layer PCB in KiCad, which was fully routed and hand-assembled. 
												The board includes mounting holes for secure installation and uses pogo pins to provide reliable 
												electrical contact with both the stimulation plates and the Y-cell test chamber. 
												The PCB consolidates the microcontroller, signal conditioning, and power delivery circuits into 
												a compact and maintainable design, improving both reliability and usability for laboratory experiments.

												<h3>Firmware</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>
												Firmware for FishShocker9000 was developed in C/C++ using the PlatformIO environment, giving the system precise, deterministic control over pulse generation and timing. 
												The modular code structure (include/, src/, lib/) enables scalability and makes it easier to extend functionality in later versions. 
												The firmware includes routines for timing adjustments, pulse shaping, and fail-safes to protect the system during high-voltage operation. 
												As the project evolves, the firmware will also serve as the interface point between 
												the custom PCB hardware and the computer vision module, enabling automated, closed-loop control of fish stimulation.

												<h3>Software Testing</h3>
											</header>
                                            <p>
												To validate performance and ensure reliability, supporting scripts in Python were developed to automate testing and parameter tuning. 
												These scripts, combined with oscilloscope measurements, allowed for systematic validation of pulse timing, amplitude, and stability across different test conditions. 
												The use of a software-driven test framework not only provided repeatability but also enabled early preparation for integration with CV-based automation. 
												In future versions, the software layer will expand to include image processing pipelines 
												that can detect zebrafish in real time and trigger electrical stimulation automatically, reducing the workload on researchers and improving experimental consistency.
