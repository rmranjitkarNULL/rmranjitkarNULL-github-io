            <p>
              The project involved designing, fabricating, and testing a 2-DOF translational manipulator mounted on a Pololu Romi 32U4 mobile platform to 
              autonomously swap boxes across a three-level shelf. The system was composed entirely of custom 3D-printed ABS components, including 
              linkages, gears, and bearing mounts, all modeled and iteratively refined in SolidWorks. Each component underwent finite element analysis 
              (FEA) to ensure strength and stiffness while minimizing weight, and motion simulations were conducted to verify link maneuverability, 
              workspace reachability, and parallel end-effector motion before fabrication. A 20:1 worm-gear reduction provided the necessary torque for 
              actuation, while a pantograph linkage maintained the gripper’s parallel orientation to the ground. 
              Together, these design elements resulted in a robust, efficient manipulator capable of precise and repeatable mechanical operation.

                <p>
                  The manipulator was built around a five-bar planar linkage, driven by a DC motor through a 20:1 worm-gear stage and a 
                  servo motor with a 2:1 gear reduction for smoother, slower motion. All links, mounts, and structural elements were custom-designed 
                  and 3D-printed in ABS, providing flexibility for rapid iteration. Bearings and press-fit axles ensured low-friction joints and 
                  consistent alignment. The pantograph-style parallelogram connecting the end-effector maintained horizontal orientation throughout its 
                  motion, simplifying grasping and improving mechanical precision. Emphasis was placed on geometric symmetry, compactness, and manufacturability 
                  using student-accessible fabrication methods.

                  The design process was heavily analysis-driven. Using SolidWorks Simulation, 
                  FEA was performed on critical links to confirm safety factors above 2.0 under expected loading. 
                  Free-body diagrams (FBDs) and MATLAB modeling quantified forces and torques at each joint, 
                  validating actuator sizing and link geometry. Additional tipping and stability calculations 
                  were performed to ensure the Romi platform maintained balance at full extension. 
                  These analyses guided design refinements—such as shortening the upper links and increasing bushing wall
                  thickness—to maximize stiffness while minimizing weight and part count.

                  While the project emphasized mechanical design, the control system enabled smooth, coordinated motion. 
                  The Romi chassis provided base mobility, and onboard microcontrollers handled servo and motor actuation using inverse-kinematics-based 
                  position control. Commands were issued over serial communication for precise incremental movement. 
                  The software layer primarily ensured reliable coordination between wheel movement 
                  and manipulator motion, complementing the mechanical system’s inherent stability and accuracy without overcomplicating the architecture.

                  During physical testing, the manipulator successfully executed all project deliverables, including navigating to the shelf, 
                  grasping and swapping boxes at multiple heights, and returning to its starting position. The design withstood extended 
                  operation without structural deformation or component failure. Performance metrics such as link deflection, repeatability, 
                  and grasp consistency matched simulated predictions. The system demonstrated high reliability under load and maintained end-effector 
                  alignment across the entire workspace. Despite early challenges—such as servo overheating and battery voltage drops—iterative mechanical 
                  and wiring refinements produced a stable and fully functional prototype that met all competition requirements.
