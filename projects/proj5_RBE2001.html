            <p>
              This project involved designing, fabricating, and testing a <strong>2-DoF translational planar manipulator</strong> 
              mounted on a <strong>Pololu Romi 32U4 mobile platform</strong> to autonomously swap boxes across a three-level shelf.
              The system consisted entirely of <strong>custom 3D-printed ABS components</strong>—including linkages, gears, and bearing mounts—modeled 
              and iteratively refined in <strong>SolidWorks</strong>. 
              Each component underwent <strong>finite element analysis (FEA)</strong> to verify strength and stiffness while minimizing weight, 
              and motion simulations validated <strong>workspace reachability</strong> and <strong>parallel end-effector motion</strong>.
              A <strong>20:1 worm-gear reduction</strong> provided torque for actuation, while a <strong>pantograph linkage</strong> maintained gripper parallelism. 
              Together, these design choices yielded a precise, repeatable, and mechanically efficient manipulator.

                <p>
                  The manipulator was centered around a <strong>five-bar planar linkage</strong> driven by two actuators: 
                  a <strong>DC motor with a 20:1 worm-gear stage</strong> and a <strong>servo motor with a 2:1 gear reduction</strong> 
                  for slower, smoother motion. All links, mounts, and brackets were <strong>custom-modeled and 3D-printed in ABS</strong>, 
                  enabling rapid prototyping and iteration. 
                  <strong>Press-fit axles</strong> and <strong>ball bearings</strong> were used at each joint to ensure low-friction motion and precise alignment.
                  The <strong>pantograph-style parallelogram</strong> ensured the gripper remained level throughout its workspace, 
                  simplifying grasping tasks and improving mechanical precision. 
                  The final design prioritized <strong>symmetry, manufacturability, and robustness</strong> while using 
                  accessible student fabrication tools.

                <p>
                  The design process was <strong>analysis-driven</strong> from concept to implementation. Using 
                  <strong>SolidWorks Simulation</strong>, <strong>finite element analysis (FEA)</strong> verified that critical links 
                  maintained <strong>safety factors above 2.0</strong> under load. 
                  <strong>Free-body diagrams (FBDs)</strong> and <strong>MATLAB modeling</strong> were used to calculate joint torques, 
                  optimize actuator sizing, and refine link geometry. 
                  Additional <strong>tipping and stability calculations</strong> ensured that the Romi platform remained balanced 
                  even when the arm was fully extended. 
                  Iterative refinements—such as shortening upper links and thickening bushings—improved stiffness and reduced deflection, 
                  resulting in a more stable and efficient mechanical assembly.

                  Although the focus of the project was on mechanical design, an integrated <strong>control system</strong> 
                  enabled synchronized actuation between the manipulator and the mobile base. 
                  The <strong>Romi microcontroller</strong> coordinated servo and DC motor actuation through an 
                  <strong>inverse-kinematics-based position control</strong> framework. 
                  Motion commands were transmitted via <strong>serial communication</strong>, allowing precise incremental control 
                  of both joint and base movement. 
                  The software architecture emphasized <strong>reliability and simplicity</strong>, enabling smooth, 
                  coordinated motion without overcomplicating the control logic. 
                  The system demonstrated the synergy between careful mechanical design and efficient embedded control.

                  During testing, the manipulator successfully performed all required tasks—navigating to the shelf, 
                  grasping and swapping boxes at multiple heights, and returning to its starting position. 
                  The structure remained stable and deformation-free under continuous operation, validating 
                  <strong>FEA predictions</strong> and <strong>mechanical tolerances</strong>. 
                  Measured <strong>repeatability</strong> and <strong>grasp consistency</strong> closely matched simulation results, 
                  confirming the accuracy of the design models. 
                  Despite early challenges such as servo overheating and voltage drops, iterative refinements to 
                  the power delivery and linkage design produced a reliable and fully functional prototype that 
                  met all project requirements and competition benchmarks.
