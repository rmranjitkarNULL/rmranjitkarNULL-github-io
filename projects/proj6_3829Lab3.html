										<h1>Light Sensor Interface on Basys3 Board</h1>
									</header>
										<p>
											This FPGA-based project focused on developing a reliable and high-speed light sensor interface 
											on the Digilent Basys3 board using Verilog. The system implemented a custom Master SPI interface 
											capable of reading sensor data at up to 2&nbsp;Mbps, with simulation and hardware validation 
											confirming transfer accuracy above 99%. Through careful timing design and clock-domain 
											synchronization, the interface achieved robust, real-time light sensing suitable for 
											laboratory instrumentation and embedded FPGA systems.

											<h3>Design Approach</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The design began with constructing a custom SPI Master in Verilog to communicate with an external 
											light sensor module. The SPI logic was built around a configurable clock divider and a finite state 
											machine (FSM) that governed the data transmission, reception, and chip-select control. 
											A simulation-based development cycle allowed fine-tuning of timing and setup/hold parameters. 
											A Verilog testbench was written to emulate sensor responses under varying light intensities, 
											reducing debugging time by roughly 30%. 
											The FPGA system clock was configured at 10&nbsp;MHz using the Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCM), 
											and a double flip-flop synchronizer was introduced to safely interface asynchronous sensor inputs, 
											eliminating metastability and improving timing reliability by approximately 40%.

											<h3>Implementation</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The SPI Master operated in Mode&nbsp;0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0) with an adjustable baud rate up to 2&nbsp;Mbps. 
											A control FSM managed <code>MOSI</code>, <code>MISO</code>, and <code>SCLK</code> signals across 
											transmission phases while maintaining precise timing margins verified in Vivado simulations. 
											On the Basys3 hardware, the SPI signals were routed through PMOD headers to an external light 
											sensor module. Data was sampled, synchronized, and displayed in real time using onboard LEDs 
											and the seven-segment display. Hardware validation under different light levels showed 
											consistent data capture with over 99% transmission reliability and no metastability failures. 
											All modules were synthesized using Xilinx Vivado, and timing reports confirmed 
											successful operation at the target 10&nbsp;MHz system clock.

											<h3>Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The final design delivered a fully functional FPGA-based light sensor interface with 
											reliable SPI communication, precise timing control, and real-time data acquisition. 
											Simulations and on-board testing validated performance across dynamic light conditions, 
											with SPI throughput stable at 2&nbsp;Mbps and signal integrity maintained across all test cases. 
											The integration of the MMCM-generated clock and synchronizer logic ensured deterministic timing, 
											while the FSM-based architecture maintained clean transitions between transmit and receive states. 
											This project demonstrated proficiency in Verilog design, timing analysis, and FPGA-based sensor 
											interfacing â€” key foundations for larger embedded and hardware co-design systems.
